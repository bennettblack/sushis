Create an image in the style of an old Japanese woodblock print, 
depicting a purple elephant holding a piece of sushi with its trunk. 
The elephant stands in an ancient Japanese landscape, with rolling hills, 
cherry blossoms, and a serene river flowing in the background. The sky is 
filled with delicate clouds and a soft, pastel-colored sunset. The elephant's 
texture resembles the intricate patterns often seen in woodblock prints, with 
bold outlines and stylized features. The sushi, a simple yet elegant nigiri, 
is held gracefully. This landscape-oriented image combines traditional Japanese 
art elements with the fantastical subject of a purple elephant.
